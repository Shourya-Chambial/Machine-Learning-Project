# Project Title: Detection of Offensive Language on Social Media to Prevent  Emerging Cybercrimes in India and Indigenous Investigation techniques
# Abstract: As the population of users of social media is increasing by the minute, itâ€™s difficult to segregate which user is bringing value to these platforms due to which a significant amount of users are actively spreading hate which is not causing anyone any good, social media also makes people anonymous thus, it has become even more difficult to curb such instances. Thus we as a team plan to propose a solution that predicts if the textual content has any traces of hate, sexism, racism, etc. so that the authorities can further ban the identified accounts.
